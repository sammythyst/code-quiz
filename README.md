## Description
The purpose of this project is to test users on their coding knowledge by asking multiple choice questions. Users are given 75 seconds, which is displayed with a timer in the upper right corner of the page, however with every incorrect answer, the player loses 10 seconds. At the end of the quiz, whatever time remains on the timer is the user;s quiz score. Users are then prompted to input their initials to log their score in a high scores leaderboard.

## Usage
To start the quiz, hit the "Start Quiz" button on screen. The timer will start immediately and you will have 75 seconds to finish. Wrong answers penalize you 10 seconds. At the end of the quiz, your remaining time is your final score and you will be prompted to add your initials (along with your score) to the leaderboard, which can be viewed after submitting your score or at any time through the "View high scores" at the top left of the page.
